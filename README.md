# Perspective Analysis Project

## üìå Problem Description
In a world where information is abundant, analyzing data from multiple perspectives is essential to derive meaningful insights. Traditional data analysis often focuses on a single viewpoint, which can overlook hidden trends and relationships. **Perspective Analysis** is a methodology that examines data from different dimensions, ensuring a holistic understanding of the problem.

This project applies **Perspective Analysis** on a given dataset to identify trends, anomalies, and correlations from multiple viewpoints. By using advanced data visualization and analysis techniques, the project highlights how perspective-based insights can aid in better decision-making.

## üí° Project Idea
The main idea of this project is to:
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** from multiple perspectives.
- Analyze data across various dimensions such as time, categories, and metrics.
- Visualize patterns using advanced plots to gain a broader understanding.
- Provide a framework where decision-makers can see **different perspectives** of the same dataset.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation
The project was implemented in the following stages:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Imported the dataset into Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
   - Verified structure and quality of the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned missing and inconsistent data.
   - Formatted columns for proper analysis (dates, numerical values, categories).

3. **Perspective-based Analysis**
   - **Time-based Analysis**: Studied how data trends change over time.
   - **Category-based Analysis**: Compared metrics across different groups/categories.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Discovered relationships among variables.
   - **Outlier & Anomaly Detection**: Identified irregular patterns.

4. **Visualization**
   - Line charts for time trends.
   - Bar charts and grouped plots for category analysis.
   - Heatmaps for correlations.
   - Boxplots for outlier detection.

5. **Insights & Summary**
   - Highlighted key findings from each perspective.
   - Compared how different perspectives give unique insights.
